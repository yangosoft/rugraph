This is a toy project to learn Rust. Not intended for real use.



Current features:

* Undirected graph implementation
* Directed graph implementation
* Multi directed graph implementation
* All simple path algorithm implemented
* Dot file export for Graphivz
* Dot file import 


Some pitfalls:

* No proper interfaces
* No properly modularized 
* Not idiomatic?
* Perfomance?
* ...
